# AgentM
AgentM is a library of "Micro Agents" that make it easy to add reliable intelligence to any application. The philosophy behind AgentM is that "Agents" should be mostly comprised of deterministic code with a sprinkle of LLM powered intelligence mixed in. Many of the existing Agent frameworks place the LLM at the center of the application as an orchestrator that calls a collection of tools. In an AgentM application, your code is the orchestrator and you only call a micro agent when you need to perform a task that requires intelligence. The initial draft of AgentM was written in JavaScript but a .net version is coming soon. Check out the [JavaScript version](https://github.com/Stevenic/agentm-js) to get a sense of AgentM's current feature set.
